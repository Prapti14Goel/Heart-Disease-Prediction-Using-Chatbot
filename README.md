# Prapti14Goel-Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Chatbot

This repository contains the source code and resources for a mobile application developed using Flutter for cross-platform experience, integrating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for analyzing medical imaging data to provide predictive insights related to heart disease. The application also features a chatbot interface for user interaction, making the application user-friendly and accessible.

Features:
Cross-platform Mobile Application: Developed using Flutter framework, ensuring a smooth and consistent user experience across iOS and Android platforms.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Integration: Utilizes a CNN model to analyze medical imaging data related to heart disease for predictive insights.
Chatbot Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for users to input information and receive real-time feedback regarding heart disease prediction and monitoring.
User Engagement: Enhances user engagement through Flutter's smooth and responsive UI, making it convenient for users to interact with the system.

Requirements:
Flutter SDK (v2.0 or higher)
Python (v3.0 or higher) with required libraries for CNN implementation
Supported IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Android Studio) for Flutter development

Usage:
Upon launching the application, users can interact with the chatbot interface to input relevant information related to heart disease prediction.
The CNN model will process medical imaging data to provide predictive insights, which will be displayed to the user in real-time.
Users can navigate through different features of the application using Flutter's intuitive UI components.
